Greenville Police Officer Michael Tierney and sheriff's Deputy Frank Abella fired 24 rounds at Swilling, hitting him 7 times. \"He never showed any fear,\" Abella would later write. \"I knew some of my shots were hitting him but he just kept on coming.\" The Greenville County Coroner's Office ruled Swilling's death a suicide.","cdvFlag":"","cdvNote":"","cityName":"Greenville","closed":{"$date":"2013-05-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"completed":{"$date":"2013-02-26T00:00:00.000Z"},"county":"GREENVILLE","countyPopulation":"Greenville","dataNotesExtraField":"Seems like clear suicide by cop but has proved controversial","dateOfGsrTest":"","dateOfWitnessStatements":"","dateOfficersInterviewed":"","daysOfInvestigation":NumberInt(43),"hasAllegationOfExcessiveForce":"","hasFile":"","hasMentalHealthIssues":"true","howLongAfterWasInterview":"17 days","latitude":34.8550151,"lengthOfTimeToObtainWitnessStatements":"3 days","lightLevelsAtScene":"Dark, raining","longitude":-82.394829,"missingData":"","noPdShotsFlag":"","numOfInterviews":NumberInt(1),"numOfInventigators":"","numOfWitnessStatementsTaken":NumberInt(9),"officerAge":NumberInt(31),"officerInjured":NumberInt(0),"officerKilled":NumberInt(0),"officerName":"Frank Abella","officerRace":"","officerRoundsFired":NumberInt(24),"officerWalkedThroughScene":"false","officerWasOnDuty":"","opened":{"$date":"2013-01-14T00:00:00.000Z"},"pagesInPdf":NumberInt(322),"reptr":"DMS","reptrFlag":"","revisor":"","secondOfficerName":"Michael Tierney","solicitorName":"Wilkins","status":"CLOSED","streetAddress":"4 McGee St.","suicideFlag":"","suspectAge":NumberInt(31),"suspectInjured":NumberInt(0),"suspectKilled":NumberInt(1),"suspectName":"Wesley Swilling","suspectOffense":"ASSAULT","suspectRace":"W","suspectWeapon":"None","themesAndToDo":"","timeOfDay":NumberInt(315),"typeExtraField":"It looked like a real gun","video":"","wasClothingTestedForGsr":"false","wasIncidentVideotaped":"true","wasJustified":"true","wasOfficerClothingPhotographed":"false","wasOfficerInterviewedSeperately":"true","wasOfficerMirandized":"true","wasOfficerStatementVoluntary":"V","wasOfficerWeaponReturned":"","wasOfficerWeaponSeized":"true","wasSceneVideotaped":"false","wasShootingAfterCarChase":"false","wasShootingAfterFootchase":"false","wasTaserDeployed":"false","zipcode":NumberInt(29601)}

The report states, \"As R/O was approaching the vehicle from the rear the officer on the drivers side fired three or four shots into the vehicle and stated, 'the suspect grabbed my gun.' \" According to a press release from the North Augusta Public Safety office regarding the time of the shooting, \"Simultaneous to Edgefield County’s arrival, the pursuit ended at a residence on Rose Road off Hwy 25.
