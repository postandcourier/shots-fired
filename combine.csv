The vehicle didn't stop. Craven reportedly fired several shots through the driver's side of the car during a chase that ended when Satterwhite pulled into his driveway to park his car. Craven claimed that Satterwhite tried to grab a gun. Four shots struck Craven on left side. Satterwhite was unarmed. Family settled a lawsuit against North Augusta Public Safety and Edgefield County Sheriff's Office for $1.1 million.  Craven was indicted for ""misconduct in office"" by an Edgefield County Grand Jury.  Lawsuit said it was ""a low-speed"" pursuit. Lawsuit alleged that Craven was told to terminate the pursuit once he crossed into Edgefield County.  Lawsuit alleges that Craven and another NAPS officer drew their guns. Craven is alleged to have walked up to the dirve'rs door and without provcation or warning fired at least five shots, stri,ing him four times. Craven denied their was a struggle.  Alleged that NAPS engages in a pattern of abusing and using inappropriate practices ... and fails to properly document and record incidents in the use of excessive force. C. Carter Elliott of Georgetown was the lawyer.  Cravens later charged with a felony charge of discharging a firearam into a vehicle while occupied.  Craven reportedly is still employed by the city.  Note that the same day that Slager was charged, Craven was charged.","The incident reportedly was captured on video. From the Edgefield Daily:  According to the ECSO incident report, a Sheriff's Sergeant joined the chase with two NAPD officers shortly after they entered Edgefield County on Highway 25. The chase continued as Satterwhite turned onto Rose Drive and then pulled into his yard.

At that time, the reporting officer (R/O) reported that one NAPD officer approached the driver's side door as the other, who was behind the deputy, approached the passenger side door. The report states, ""As R/O was approaching the vehicle from the rear the officer on the drivers side fired three or four shots into the vehicle and stated, 'the suspect grabbed my gun.' "" According to a press release from the North Augusta Public Safety office regarding the time of the shooting, ""Simultaneous to Edgefield County’s arrival, the pursuit ended at a residence on Rose Road off Hwy 25.  Law Enforcement approached the suspect vehicle and an altercation ensued and shots were fired. During the confrontation, Officer (Justin) Craven shot 68-year old, Earnest Satterwhite, Sr."" The statement said the initial traffic stop was for a suspected DUI violation. Earlier information stated Satterwhite was outside of the car at the time of the shooting.
