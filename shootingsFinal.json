Deputies shot and wounded the man, Ricky Clark, because he allegedly tried to hit them with the vehicle, and also charged Clark with attempted murder. Charges against Clark were later dropped. Tenth Circuit Solicitor Chrissy Adams said: \"After a thorough investigation into Deputy (Eric) Nubern’s actions during this traffic stop and based on his prior conduct as a law enforcement officer, his credibility as the primary witness in these cases creates a fatal flaw in the sufficiency of the evidence.\" Clark told investigators that Nubern - they knew each other from prior encounters - had been harassing and threatening him, and he tried to elude the deputies after Nubern pulled up next to him and held his pistol up for Clark to see. Investigators were also told that Nubern was quite familiar with the truck Clark was driving (owned by his step-daughter's husband), and knew the truck wasn't stolen. Clark voluntarily took a lie-detector test.

The State reported that Solicitor Adams dropped the attempted-murder charge against Clark, and told a Spartanburg TV station recently the convicted felon’s account was more believable than the deputy’s. Nubern’s version did not add up, Adams said, and his history of internal affairs investigations made him untrustworthy.
