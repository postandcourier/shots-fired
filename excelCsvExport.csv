Clark told investigators that Nubern - they knew each other from prior encounters - had been harassing and threatening him, and he tried to elude the deputies after Nubern pulled up next to him and held his pistol up for Clark to see. Investigators were also told that Nubern was quite familiar with the truck Clark was driving (owned by his step-daughter's husband), and knew the truck wasn't stolen.
